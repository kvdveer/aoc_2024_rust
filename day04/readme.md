# Advent of Code day 4

This is the first grid-based puzzle. I guess my `aoc_grid` will make it's reentry here.

## Part 1

Every cell can start an 'XMAS' sequence in 8 directions. For the initial solve, I'll just brute force all of those possibilities.

## Part 2

The orientation is different. If focus on the center A, each cell has 4 possible configurations that are considered valid.

## Reflection

Having a grid library was a huge help here, especially the direction vector.
